# flutter_application_1

A new Flutter project.

Made following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lDJNFSWUD8

I won't provide much in the way of a proper readme as this was made following the above tutorial. This was a good next step from the basic Flutter tutorial. The construction concepts kind of opened up a bit more for me, and I feel I really started to grasp the sort of basic structure of how apps are built. The inclusion of backend stuff was also nice, as it felt simple-ish, and fairly easy to take on from a sort of novice Flutter coder position. There's of course plenty of concepts to explore in greater depth, but I feel that Flutter is fairly easy to use. The styling is still the only thing that feels limited and limiting, but I suppose more practice will open up more possibilities. Enjoy!
